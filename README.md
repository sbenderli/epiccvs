# EPIC CVs

This project is a **satirical website** that imagines how famous (or infamous) historical figures might present themselves if they were writing modern résumés or LinkedIn profiles.

⚠️ **Important disclaimer**  
- These résumés are entirely fictional.  
- They are written for humor, commentary, and educational purposes.  
- They should not be taken as factual, career advice, or endorsements of the individuals depicted.  

## How it works
- Résumés are stored as Markdown files in `resumes/`.  
- A small script (`gen_manifest.py`) generates `resumes.json` as a manifest.  
- The site (served via GitHub Pages) dynamically loads that manifest and displays the résumés in the browser.
