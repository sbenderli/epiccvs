## **Experience**  

**King & Chief Legislator**  
*Babylon | 1792–1750 BCE*  
- **Authored the Code of Hammurabi**: 282-point legal framework addressing everything from contractor liability to proper hand-loss procedures.
- **Construction Quality Assurance**: Implemented a zero-tolerance defect policy. Builder whose house collapses? Builder is executed. *Problem permanently solved.*
- **Debt Restructuring**: Introduced debt slavery with built-in exit clause (death or 7-year terms). Dramatically streamlined personal finance sector.
- **Workplace Safety & Compliance**: Instituted strict protocols for merchants, craftsmen, and physicians. Doctor performs faulty surgery? Loses dominant hand. *Physicians reported 87% improvement in surgical precision with remaining hand.*
- **Judicial Consistency**: Standardized punishment across all 32 districts. Judge handing out inconsistent sentences? Removed from bench permanently (via exile, flogging, or appropriate consequence).
- **Irrigation Infrastructure**: Designed and funded massive Euphrates water systems, effectively weaponizing regional drought protection.
- **Eye-Witness Testimony Verification**: Implemented Oath-of-God protocol. Liars were drowned immediately. *Legal fraud: 0%.*
- **Child Support Enforcement**: Established non-negotiable father-to-child financial obligations. Non-compliance meant slavery, amputation, or execution (tiered pricing).

**Heir Apparent & Apprentice Kingship**  
*Babylon Under Sin-Muballit | 1805–1792 BCE*  
- Shadowed outgoing executive during territorial expansion (acquisitions of Kish, Sippar, Borsippa).
- Identified critical gaps in existing legal frameworks (i.e., "people keep disputing ownership claims and we have to keep holding trials").
- Prototyped solutions that would later define tenure.
- Learned hydroelectric warfare and divine branding techniques.
