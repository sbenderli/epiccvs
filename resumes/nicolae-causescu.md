## Notable Achievements  
- **CEO of Romania, Inc. (1965–1989):** Oversaw vertical integration of state, party, and self into one seamless dictatorship.  
- **Brand Management Expert:** Cultivated one of history’s most aggressive personality cults, ensuring every bookshelf, classroom, and TV broadcast featured me and my wife Elena.
