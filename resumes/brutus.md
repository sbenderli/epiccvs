### Core Competencies
- **Authoritarian Resistance:** Championed the *Republic Preservation Program*, framing myself as the original anti-fascist (before it was cool).  
- **Hostile Takeover Execution:** Spearheaded the *Ides of March* multi-senator “knife-based restructuring initiative.”  
- **Ethical Branding:** Rebranded personal betrayal as civic virtue — *“Not murder, just democracy maintenance.”*

### Experience  

**Lead Change Agent – The Ides of March Project**  
*Rome, 44 BCE*  
- Coordinated over 60 co-conspirators to deliver a synchronized performance review of Caesar’s permanent dictatorship.  
- Provided personal “feedback” in the form of dagger input, scoring a critical hit under high-stress conditions and delivering 23 stabs for maximum impact.  
- Ensured exit messaging resonated: Caesar’s final feedback was immortalized, with exit survey results widely circulated across Rome.  

**Provincial Governor – Cyprus Operations**  
*Rome, 53 BCE*  
- Managed resource extraction and revenue pipelines, demonstrating strong financial governance.  
- Implemented aggressive tax collection policies, ensuring steady cashflow for senatorial war chest.

**Republican Freedom Fighter – Pompey Alliance**  
*Greece & Asia Minor, 49–48 BCE*  
- Initially aligned with Pompey against Caesar in civil conflict, surviving the Battle of Pharsalus.  
- Displayed adaptability by negotiating reconciliation with Caesar — until pivoting to “termination strategy” later.  

**Co-CEO – Post-Caesar Startup (Brutus & Cassius LLC)**  
*East, 44–42 BCE*  
- Raised armies and funding across Asia Minor to defend the Republic from the emerging fascist startup “Second Triumvirate, Inc.”  
- Operated out of Sardis and later Philippi, demonstrating cross-regional logistics leadership.  
- Final quarterly review ended in self-offboarding at the Battle of Philippi after underperforming against Antony & Octavian.
